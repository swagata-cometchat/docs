> This page indexes focused, task‑oriented feature guides for the iOS UI Kit. Each guide shows how to implement a specific capability end‑to‑end using UIKit components plus Core / Calls SDK APIs.

## When to Use These Guides

Use these after completing [Getting Started](/ui-kit/ios/getting-started) and wiring your base conversations / messages flows. Apply them to layer feature depth without rebuilding standard patterns.

## Guide Directory

| Guide | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| [Block / Unblock User](/ui-kit/ios/guide-block-unblock-user) | Add profile-level moderation so users can block or unblock others; hides interaction affordances and protects chat flow. |

| [Group Ownership Transfer](/ui-kit/ios/guide-group-ownership) | Allow admins to hand over group ownership securely to another member. |
| [Message Privately](/ui-kit/ios/guide-message-privately) | Launch a direct 1:1 conversation from a user profile or list; optionally seed with an initial message. |
| [New Chat](/ui-kit/ios/guide-new-chat) | Offer a unified entry to discover users & groups and jump into new conversations quickly. |
| [Threaded Messages](/ui-kit/ios/guide-threaded-messages) | Add threaded reply views so users can branch focused discussions off individual messages. |
