<Tabs>
<Tab title="CocoaPods">
We recommend using CocoaPods, as they are the most advanced way of managing iOS project dependencies.

1. Create pod file by running the following command in your project's base level:

```ruby Swift
pod init
```

2. Add CometChat SDKs to Your Podfile:

```ruby Swift
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
  # CometChat UI Kit for Swift
  pod 'CometChatUIKitSwift', '5.0.10'

  # Optional: Include if you're using Audio/Video Calling
  pod 'CometChatCallsSDK', '4.2.0'
end
```

3. Install the CometChat UI Kit framework through CocoaPods:

```ruby Swift
pod install
```

If you're facing any issues while installing pods, use the following command:

```ruby Swift
pod install --repo-update
```

To get the latest version of CometChat UI Kit, use:

```ruby Swift
pod update CometChatUIKitSwift
pod update CometChatCallsSDK
```

<Tip>

Always ensure to open the XCFramework file after adding the dependencies.

</Tip>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Swift Package Manager (SPM)">
**Swift Package Manager** (SPM) is Apple's built-in tool for managing dependencies in Swift projects. It allows developers to integrate and manage third-party libraries seamlessly.

1. Go to **File** tab and select **Add Package Dependencies.**

2. Enter the repository URL of the Swift package:

```
https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-uikit-ios
```

3. To add the package, select Version Rules, enter Up to Exact Version and click Add package.

   Exact Version:

   ```
   5.0.10
   ```

4. Add `CometChatSDK` repeating the above steps for following link and exact version:

   Link:

   ```
   https://github.com/cometchat/chat-sdk-ios
   ```

   Exact Version:

   ```
   4.0.69
   ```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

***

### **Configure Privacy Permissions**

1. To enable media messaging in your app, you must allow **Camera**, **Microphone**, and **Photo Library** access in `Info.plist`. These permissions are required for sending and receiving media files.

   ```ruby Info.plist
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Allow access to the camera to capture photos and videos.</string>

   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Enable microphone access for voice and video communication.</string>

   <key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Allow saving photos and videos to your device's photo library.</string>

   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Grant access to select and upload photos from your library.</string>
   ```

   </Frame>

***

### **Step 4: Initialize & Login to CometChat UI Kit**

To authenticate a user, you need a **`UID`**. You can either:

1. **Create new users** on the **[CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com)**, **[CometChat SDK Method](/ui-kit/react/methods#create-user)** or **[via the API](https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/creates-user)**.

2. **Use pre-generated test users**:

   * `cometchat-uid-1`
   * `cometchat-uid-2`
   * `cometchat-uid-3`
   * `cometchat-uid-4`
   * `cometchat-uid-5`

The **Login** method returns a **User object** containing all relevant details of the logged-in user.

***

<Note>

**Security Best Practices**

* The **Auth Key** method is recommended for **proof-of-concept (POC) development** and early-stage testing.
* For **production environments**, it is strongly advised to use an **[Auth Token](/ui-kit/ios/methods#login-using-auth-token)** instead of an **Auth Key** to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

</Note>

You can initialize CometChat and log in a user in your `SceneDelegate.swift` file:

> ⚠️ **Important:** Initialization and login are independent steps. However, the CometChat SDK **must be initialized before** you call the login method.

```swift SceneDelegate.swift highlight={13-15} lines
import UIKit
import CometChatUIKitSwift

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

        guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

        let uikitSettings = UIKitSettings()
            .set(appID: "<#Enter Your App ID Here#>")
            .set(region: "<#Enter Your Region Code Here#>")
            .set(authKey: "<#Enter Your AuthKey Here#>")
            .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
            .build()

        CometChatUIKit.init(uiKitSettings: uikitSettings) { result in
            switch result {
            case .success:
                debugPrint("CometChat UI Kit initialization succeeded")

                let uid = "cometchat-uid-1"

                CometChatUIKit.login(uid: uid) { loginResult in
                    switch loginResult {
                    case .success:
                        debugPrint("CometChat UI Kit login succeeded")

                    // ✅ Option 1: Launch One-to-One or Group Chat Screen
                    // DispatchQueue.main.async { 
                    //  self.setUpOneOneOrGroupConversation(windowScene: windowScene, uid: "cometchat-uid-2")
                    // }

                    // ✅ Option 2: Launch Conversation List + Message View (Split-Screen Style)
                    // DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    //  self.setupConversationsView(windowScene: windowScene)
                    // }

                    // ✅ Option 3: Launch Tab-Based Chat Experience (Chats, Calls, Users, Groups)
                    // DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    //    self.setupTabbedView(windowScene: windowScene)
                    // }
            
                    case .onError(let error):
                        debugPrint("CometChat UI Kit login failed with error: \(error.description)")
                    @unknown default:
                        break
                    }
                }

            case .failure(let error):
                debugPrint("CometChat UI Kit initialization failed with error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<Info>

Ensure you replace the following placeholders with your actual CometChat credentials:

* App ID → Your CometChat App ID
* Auth Key → Your CometChat Auth Key
* Region → Your App Region

These values are required for proper authentication and seamless integration.

</Info>

After running the app, you should see the following log message:

```sh Console
"CometChat UI Kit initialization succeeded"
"CometChat UI Kit login succeeded"
```
