> This page indexes focused, task‑oriented feature guides for the React UI Kit. Each guide shows how to implement a specific capability end‑to‑end using UI components.

## When to Use These Guides

Use these guides after completing the base [Getting Started](/ui-kit/react/react-js-integration) (or framework variant: [Next.js](/ui-kit/react/next-js-integration), [React Router](/ui-kit/react/react-router-integration)). They help you layer additional UX without rewriting core chat flows.
