### Actions

[Actions](/ui-kit/react-native/components-overview#actions) dictate how a component functions. They are divided into two types: Predefined and User-defined. You can override either type, allowing you to tailor the behavior of the component to fit your specific needs.

##### onError

### Advanced

For advanced-level customization, you can set custom views to the component. This lets you tailor each aspect of the component to fit your exact needs and application aesthetics. You can create and define your views, layouts, and UI elements and then incorporate those into the component.

The `CometChatCallButtons` component does not provide additional functionalities beyond this level of customization.

## Configurations

[Configurations](/ui-kit/android/components-overview#configurations) offer the ability to customize the properties of each individual component within a Composite Component.

* `Configurations` expose properties that are available in its individual components.

#### Outgoing Call

You can customize the properties of the Outgoing Call component by making use of the `OutgoingCallConfiguration`. You can accomplish this by employing the `OutgoingCallConfiguration` as demonstrated below:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="App.tsx">
```tsx
import {
  CometChatCallButtons,
  OutgoingCallConfiguration,
} from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react-native";
//code
const theme: CometChatTheme = useTheme();
//more code
const getOutgoingCallConfig = () => {
  return new OutgoingCallConfiguration({
    disableSoundForCalls: true,
  });
};
return (
  <CometChatCallButtons
    user={user}
    outgoingCallConfiguration={getOutgoingCallConfig()}
  />
);
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

All exposed properties of `OutgoingCallConfiguration` can be found under [Outgoing Call](/ui-kit/react-native/12-outgoing-call.md).
