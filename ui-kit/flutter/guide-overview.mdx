> This page indexes focused, task‑oriented feature guides for the Flutter UI Kit. Each guide shows how to implement a specific capability end‑to‑end using UI kit components.

## When to Use These Guides

Use these after finishing [Getting Started](/ui-kit/flutter/getting-started) and wiring a basic conversations/messages experience. Add them incrementally to deepen functionality without rebuilding fundamentals.
