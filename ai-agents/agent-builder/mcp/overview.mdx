## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) expands your agent’s context, tools, and integrations. It provides a standard way to connect agents with external services and data sources—ideal for knowledge bases, internal systems, or advanced workflows that go beyond simple API calls.

## Add an MCP endpoint

1. In Agent Builder, open the **MCP** section of your agent configuration.
2. Click **+ Add Endpoint**.
3. Supply the endpoint details:
   - **Endpoint Name*** – descriptive label for teammates.
   - **Endpoint URL*** – full URL to your MCP server (for example `https://example.com/mcp-server`).
   - **Description** – explain what the endpoint provides so you can distinguish multiple connections later.
   - **Icon URL** – optional image to represent the endpoint (for example `https://example.com/icon.png`).
4. Save to register the endpoint with your agent.

## Using MCP-powered tools and context

- Once configured, MCP endpoints and the tools they expose appear in the `@` picker alongside native tools.
- Embed MCP resources directly in instructions to show the agent when to use them.
- During conversations, the agent can automatically discover MCP-provided tools and contextual data.

Reference identifiers returned from MCP (like `order_id` or `ticket_number`) inside your custom API tools so the agent can complete the workflow end-to-end.
</Callout>

## Best practices

- Choose MCP servers with reliable uptime and predictable response times.
- Document each endpoint’s capabilities so teammates know when to enable it.
- Monitor responses in the Test console and update endpoints or filters as data changes.
