## Overview

Tools allow your AI agent to perform specific operations or integrate with external systems.  
Once created, these tools can be invoked by **Actions** to execute tasks, fetch data, or interact with third-party APIs.

You can use tools to:

- Fetch data from external APIs.
- Trigger workflows in other systems.
- Perform backend logic before returning results to the chat.
- Extend your AI agent’s capabilities beyond basic responses.

---

## Creating a tool

1. **Navigate to AI Agents → Tools** in the CometChat dashboard.
2. Click **Create Tool** and choose the type that fits your workflow (Custom API, Google Suite, or a built-in integration).
3. Enter:
   - **Display Name** – a human readable label, for example `Zendesk Ticket Creator`.
   - **Execution Text** – guidance the agent uses to decide when to invoke the tool (e.g. `Use this when a user asks to open a support ticket`).
   - **Name** – the programmatic identifier (lowercase_with_underscores). This must match the property name you expose in an Action schema.

4. Define the **Parameters** JSON schema. Every property you mark as `required` becomes an explicit value the agent must collect before the tool runs.
5. Add the target **Endpoint URL** and any HTTP headers, secrets, or request templates the tool needs.

## Custom API tools

Custom API tools are ideal when you already expose an HTTP endpoint and want the agent to call it with structured payloads.

### Setup checklist

1. Choose **Custom API** as the tool type.
2. Provide the endpoint URL (HTTPS recommended).
3. Add authentication headers such as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or HMAC signatures.
4. Describe the payload with JSON Schema. A sample schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "ticket_subject": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Short summary that becomes the Zendesk subject"
    },
    "priority": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["low", "normal", "high", "urgent"]
    },
    "customer_email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email"
    }
  },
  "required": ["ticket_subject", "customer_email"]
}
```

5. Attach the tool to an Action. The Action schema must contain a property whose key matches the tool name:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "zendesk_ticket_creator": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Payload forwarded to the ticketing webhook",
      "properties": {}
    }
  }
}
```

6. Test in the Agent Builder console and watch the **Tool Invocation** tab to validate outgoing payloads.

## Google Suite tools

Google Suite tools provide native integrations for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Docs. They manage OAuth scopes and service-account impersonation for you.

### Requirements

- A Google Cloud project with the relevant APIs enabled.
- A service account (with domain-wide delegation if required) and JSON key.
- Scopes that match the actions you expect the agent to perform (for example `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`).

### Configuration steps

1. Create a tool and pick **Google Suite** as the type.
2. Paste the service account email, client ID, and private key from the JSON file.
3. Enter the scopes and the user to impersonate (often a shared inbox or admin).
4. Choose the Google product (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.) and the specific operation you want to allow.
5. Adjust the parameter schema so the agent collects the minimum context (recipient, subject, meeting start time, etc.).
6. Save and run a test conversation. The tool response appears in the console so you can confirm authorisation.

<Callout type="info" title="Security tip">
Store the JSON key in a secrets manager and rotate it frequently. You can update the key in the dashboard without redeploying the agent.
</Callout>

## Testing & best practices

- **Name consistency is crucial** – mismatch between the tool name and the Action schema key will prevent invocation.
- **Keep execution text concise** – give the agent a clear rule for when to use the tool.
- **Document input requirements** – add `description` hints in the schema so the agent knows how to populate each field.
- **Simulate unhappy paths** – test what happens when external APIs fail or return errors. Update the system prompt so the agent recovers gracefully.
- **Monitor usage** – the dashboard logs every tool call with payloads and latency so you can audit behaviour after launch.
