# Moderation Integration

To maintain a safe, respectful, and engaging environment for your users, our platform offers a powerful **Moderation Integration** system. This system allows you to automatically review, filter, and take action on user-generated messages, images, and videos before they are delivered.

With Moderation Integration, you can define flexible rules, receive real-time updates, and ensure your app meets community guidelines, legal standards, and brand values without manual intervention.

If you’re using the CometChat UI Kit or SDK, you can skip steps 2 and 3.

## Setting Up Moderation Rules

Moderation rules act as filters to ensure that the messages exchanged within your app meet your safety and content guidelines.

### How It Works

- When a message, image, or video is submitted, it is automatically checked against the moderation rules you’ve configured.  
- These rules can detect offensive language, sensitive content, spam, scams, and more.  
- Based on your settings, content can be:  
  - **Approved:** Delivered to the recipient.  
  - **Disapproved:** Blocked and not delivered.  

### Benefits

- **Safety first:** Protect your users and brand from harmful or unwanted content.  
- **Customizable:** Fine-tune moderation rules to suit your app’s unique needs.  
- **Seamless experience:** Moderation happens in real time, keeping communication flowing smoothly.  

### Creating Moderation Rules

CometChat provides a set of **default moderation rules** designed to cover common use cases such as offensive language, spam, and inappropriate content. You can enable these rules to start moderating messages immediately, without any additional setup.

{/* ![Default moderation rules](/images/existing-rules.png) */}
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/existing-rules.png" />
</Frame>

If you have specific requirements, you can create **custom moderation rules** tailored to your app’s needs. Rules can be created in two ways:

1. **Using the CometChat Dashboard** — A simple, no-code interface for visually creating and managing moderation rules.  
   {/* ![Create rule screen](/images/create-rule.png)   */}
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/create-rule.png" />
</Frame>
2. **Using the CometChat API** — Programmatically create and manage moderation rules for advanced or automated workflows. See the [Create Rule API documentation]({apiEndpoints.createRule.url}).

## Configuring a Moderation Webhook

To automate your moderation flow and receive updates in real time, configure a **moderation webhook**. This allows your system to react instantly when a message or media is moderated.

### How It Works

- Every time content is moderated, a webhook event is triggered and sent to the URL you specify.  
- Your application can then take action based on the moderation result.  

### Prerequisites

- Your webhook URL must be accessible over **HTTPS** to ensure secure data transmission.  
- The URL should be publicly accessible from the internet.  
- Ensure your endpoint supports the `HTTP POST` method. Event payloads will be delivered via `POST` requests in JSON format.  
- Configure your endpoint to respond immediately to the CometChat server with a `200 OK` response.  
- For security, set up **Basic Authentication** (username and password) for server-to-server communication.  

When your webhook URL is triggered, the HTTP header includes:

```http
Authorization: Basic <Base64-encoded-credentials>
```

### Handle Moderation Events

Ensure your webhook endpoint is ready to process moderation events. Refer to the [Moderation Events](/docs-beta/fundamentals/webhooks-overview#moderation-events) section for the full list.

The key events to handle include:

- `moderation_engine_approved` — Triggered when the engine automatically approves content.  
- `moderation_engine_blocked` — Triggered when the engine automatically blocks content.  
- `moderation_manual_approved` — Triggered when a moderator manually approves previously blocked content.  

To receive these events, enable the relevant webhooks in the CometChat Dashboard:

> **Application → Webhooks → Create Webhook → Triggers → Moderation**

Select all three moderation triggers to ensure your app receives the necessary notifications.

## Integrating and Testing the Moderation API

Once your moderation rules and webhook are configured, integrate the **Moderation API** into your application to programmatically submit content and receive moderation results.

### Steps to Integrate and Test

1. **Submit content:** Use the API to send messages, images, or videos for moderation.  
2. **Check responses:** Verify moderation status in real time.  
3. **Handle outcomes:** Apply business logic based on approved, flagged, or disapproved responses.  
4. **End-to-end testing:** Test both the API response and webhook delivery to ensure complete coverage.  

When you’re ready, you can render all moderation endpoints dynamically:

### Send message

This endpoint is used to submit a message for moderation before it is delivered to the recipient. The message is scanned against the moderation rules configured for the app.

**URL:**
```
https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/chat-api-send-message-moderation
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "category": "message",
  "type": "text",
  "data": {
    "text": "Hi new user"
  },
  "sender": "cometchat-uid-2",
  "receiver": "cometchat-uid-1",
  "receiverType": "user",
  "sentAt": 1750335220
}
```

### List messages
Retrieves a list of messages submitted for moderation, along with the current moderation status of each message as determined by your configured rules.

**URL:**
```
https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/chat-api-list-message-moderation/
```
 
### Get message
Retrieves the details of a specific message submitted for moderation, including its current moderation status as determined by your configured rules.

**URL:**
```
https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/chat-api-get-message-moderation/
```
 
### Update message
Edits an existing message. The moderation status is re-evaluated based on your configured rules.

**URL:**
```
https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/chat-api-update-message-moderation/
```

### Delete message
Deletes a previously submitted message along with its associated moderation data, in accordance with your configured rules.

**URL:**
```
https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/chat-api-delete-message-moderation/
```
 
### Approve message
Approves a previously blocked message, allowing it to be delivered to the recipient.

**URL:**
```
https://api-explorer.cometchat.com/reference/chat-api-approve-moderation-blocked-messages/
```
