Chat Builder simplifies integrating CometChat’s iOS UI Kit using Visual Chat Builder (VCB) configuration. Design your experience, export settings, and wire them into your app via JSON or QR‑based live sync.

## Integration with CometChat Chat Builder (iOS)

Installation and configuration options from README‑iOS:

### Install the Builder package

<Tabs>
<Tab title="CocoaPods">

```ruby
pod 'CometChatBuilder'
```

```bash
pod install
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Swift Package Manager">

1. In Xcode: File → Add Packages.
2. Enter your repository URL (or local path) for `CometChatBuilder`.
3. Add the package to your app target.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Option 1: Load from JSON (no‑code)

1. Add `cometchat-builder-settings.json` to your app target (ensure it’s in Target Membership).
2. Load settings at launch:

```swift
import CometChatBuilder

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
  CometChatBuilderSettings.loadFromJSON()
  return true
}
```

### Option 2: Load via QR Code (live Builder sync)

1. Start scanning from a view controller to sync settings for the current device build:

```swift
import CometChatBuilder

CometChatBuilder.startScanning(from: self) { appliedStyle in
  // Apply theme or reload UI if needed
  print("VCB Style Applied:", appliedStyle.theme)
}
```

The SDK will open a QR scanner, fetch settings, and apply them. It handles loading UI and error fallbacks.

## Run the App

Build and run on simulator or device from Xcode. Ensure your CometChat initialization and user login logic are in place in your app.

***

## Understanding Your Builder Settings

VCB configuration spans:

- Core messaging experience (typing, media sharing, replies)
- Deeper user engagement (reactions, mentions, translation, polls)
- AI User Copilot (smart replies, summaries, starters)
- Group management
- Moderator controls
- Voice & video calling
- Layout & styling (theme, typography, layout)

***

## Troubleshooting

- For JSON: ensure the file is included in your app bundle’s Target Membership.
- For QR: confirm a valid code from the Builder and active network.
- For SPM: confirm package resources are available to your target.
