- Swift 5.7+ (or compatible Swift toolchain)
- CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager
- Internet connectivity (for CometChat services)

***

## Why Choose CometChat Builder?

- Rapid integration: Prebuilt native UI and generated settings.
- Customizable: Theme, typography, and features via configuration.
- Scalable: Backed by CometChat’s reliable chat infrastructure.
- Native UX: Components built for iOS.

## Setup Options

Choose one of the following paths to integrate:

- Load settings via Builder (recommended): Use the CometChatBuilder package and load settings via JSON or live QR sync.
  See: /chat-builder/ios/integration#install-the-builder-package,
  /chat-builder/ios/integration#option-1-load-from-json-no-code,
  /chat-builder/ios/integration#option-2-load-via-qr-code-live-builder-sync
- Start from the iOS Sample App: Use the UI Kit sample to explore structure and patterns, then add the Builder package.
