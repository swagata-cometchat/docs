## Initialise CometChat

The `init()` method initialises the settings required for CometChat. The `init()` method takes the below parameters:

1. appID - You CometChat App ID
2. appSettings - An object of the AppSettings class can be created using the AppSettingsBuilder class. The region field is mandatory and can be set using the `setRegion()` method.

The `AppSettings` class allows you to configure three settings:

* **Region**: The region where you app was created.
* **[Presence Subscription](/sdk/flutter/user-presence):** Represents the subscription type for user presence (real-time online/offline status)
* **autoEstablishSocketConnection(boolean value)**: This property takes a boolean value which when set to true informs the SDK to manage the web-socket connection internally. If set to false, it informs the SDK that the web-socket connection will be managed manually. The default value for this parameter is true. For more information on this, please check the [Connection Behaviour](/sdk/flutter/connection-behaviour) section. The default value for this property is **true.**
* **adminHost(adminHost: string)**: This method takes the admin URL as input and uses this admin URL instead of the default admin URL. This can be used in case of dedicated deployment of CometChat.
* **clientHost(clientHost: string)**: This method takes the client URL as input and uses this client URL instead of the default client URL. This can be used in case of dedicated deployment of CometChat.

<Tab title="Dart">
```dart
String region = "REGION";
String appId = "APP_ID";

AppSettings appSettings= (AppSettingsBuilder()
    ..subscriptionType = CometChatSubscriptionType.allUsers
    ..region= region
    ..adminHost = "" //optional
    ..clientHost = "" //optional
    ..autoEstablishSocketConnection =  true
).build();

CometChat.init(appId, appSettings,
  onSuccess: (String successMessage) {
    debugPrint("Initialization completed successfully  $successMessage");
  }, onError: (CometChatException excep) {
    debugPrint("Initialization failed with exception: ${excep.message}");
  }
);
```

We suggest you call the `init()` method on app startup.
