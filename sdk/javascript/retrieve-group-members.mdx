## Retrieve the List of Group Members

In order to fetch the list of groups members for a group, you can use the `GroupMembersRequest` class. To use this class i.e to create an object of the GroupMembersRequest class, you need to use the `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class. The `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the parameters based on which the groups are to be fetched.

The `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class allows you to set the below parameters:

The GUID of the group for which the members are to be fetched must be specified in the constructor of the `GroupMembersRequestBuilder` class.

### Set Limit

This method sets the limit i.e. the number of members that should be fetched in a single iteration.

<Tab title="Set Limit">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let groupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  												.setLimit(limit)
  												.build();   
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let limit: number = 30;
let groupMembersRequest: CometChat.GroupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

### Set Search Keyword

This method allows you to set the search string based on which the group members are to be fetched.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Set Search Keyword">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let searchKeyword = "super";
let groupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  												.setLimit(limit)
  												.setSearchKeyword(searchKeyword)
  												.build();
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let limit: number = 30;
let searchKeyword: string = "super";
let groupMembersRequest: CometChat.GroupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .setSearchKeyword(searchKeyword)
  .build();
```

</Tab>

### Set Scopes

This method allows you to fetch group members based on multiple scopes.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Set Scopes">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let scopes = ["admin", "moderator"];
let groupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  												.setLimit(limit)
  												.setScopes(scopes)
  												.build();
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let limit: number = 30;
let scopes: Array<String> = ["admin", "moderator"];
let groupMembersRequest: CometChat.GroupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .setScopes(scopes)
  .build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Set Status

The status based on which the group members are to be fetched. The status parameter can contain one of the below two values:

* CometChat.USER_STATUS.ONLINE - will return the list of only online group members.
* CometChat.USER_STATUS.OFFLINE - will return the list of only offline group members.

If this parameter is not set, will return all the group members regardless of their status.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Set Status">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let groupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  												.setLimit(limit)
  												.setStatus(CometChat.USER_STATUS.ONLINE)
  												.build();
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
let GUID: string = "GUID";
let limit: number = 30;
let groupMembersRequest: CometChat.GroupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .setStatus(CometChat.USER_STATUS.ONLINE)
  .build();
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Finally, once all the parameters are set to the builder class, you need to call the build() method to get the object of the `GroupMembersRequest` class.

Once you have the object of the `GroupMembersRequest` class, you need to call the `fetchNext()` method. Calling this method will return a list of `GroupMember` objects containing n number of members where n is the limit set in the builder class.

<Tab title="Group Members Request">
```javascript
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let groupMemberRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  												.setLimit(limit)
  												.build();

groupMemberRequest.fetchNext().then(
groupMembers => {
  console.log("Group Member list fetched successfully:", groupMembers);
}, error => {
  console.log("Group Member list fetching failed with exception:", error);
}
);  
```

let GUID: string = "GUID";
let limit: number = 30;
let groupMembersRequest: CometChat.GroupMembersRequest = new CometChat.GroupMembersRequestBuilder(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();

groupMembersRequest.fetchNext().then(
  (groupMembers: CometChat.GroupMember[]) => {
      console.log("Group Member list fetched successfully:", groupMembers);
  }, (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
      console.log("Group Member list fetching failed with exception:", error);
  }
);
